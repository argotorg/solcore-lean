/-! This is the actual lexical compiler traversal with its local native child
witness retained at every expression callback. One enclosing HasType suffices;
Source lookup, Source typing and compiler acceptance remain separate inputs.
The certificate factory receives the arbitrary result type supplied by native
constructor inversion. Authentic lambda hooks can normalize it afterward.
Stopped suffixes remain the original issued dead code and receive no semantic
or expression-certificate manufacture. This is a static producer, not E/F. -/
