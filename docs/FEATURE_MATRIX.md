# Feature matrix

This is the human-readable implementation ledger. It does not enable a profile
or alter a published protocol.

Status meanings:

- complete: executable behavior and the required proof boundary exist;
- active: implementation is currently being developed;
- planned: the feature has an implementation order but no complete code;
- blocked: a semantic decision or prerequisite is missing;
- frozen: retained at a versioned boundary with no active expansion;
- unsupported: the selected public profile deliberately has no meaning for it.

## Published and stable features

| Feature | Specification | Implementation and proof | Published | Syntax coupling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Version and profile separation | Normative | Complete | Oracle v1 and later | None |
| Verdict categories | Normative | Complete | Oracle v1 and later | None |
| Core unit, bool, word | Normative | Complete | Oracle v2/v3 | None |
| Immutable Core binding | Normative | Complete | Oracle v2/v3 | None |
| Core conditional | Normative | Complete | Oracle v2/v3 | None |

equality and greater-than, bitwise operations, and bounded logical shifts.

## Static semantics after Core

## Contract and runtime semantics

| Feature | Status | Missing decision or implementation | Syntax coupling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Frozen frontend snapshot

| Internal component | State at freeze |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace identity and validation | Complete and proved |
| Multi lexer | Complete for the frozen token language |
| Multi chart parser | Total selected result and soundness for the frozen grammar |
| Structural validator | Complete executable/declarative correspondence |
| Source locations | Parser-wide validity and nesting proof complete |
| Retained tokens | Exact correspondence complete for all frozen grammar rules |
| Certified one-file frontend | Complete internal proof-carrying result |
| Fast parser | Finite schedule and terminal base only; full executor incomplete |
| Structural identity | Accepted design, no implementation |
| Module/name resolution | Proposed design, no implementation |

No frozen row is a promise that the same AST or grammar will be used by the
next Surface version.

## Public compatibility rule

Semantic Core v1, Semantic Core v2, and Surface v1 are closed algebras. New Core
vNext constructors outside those algebras must fail their old wire projection.
This includes the cell forms accepted by ADR-0022 and every named-data form or
nonempty definition table accepted by ADR-0023. ADR-0024 adds no constructor:
its conversions expand into existing expressions, so each projection treats
them exactly like the corresponding handwritten expansion. Publication of any
new tag still requires a new additive version. ADR-0025 likewise adds no tag:
wire v1 rejects its primitive expansion and wire v2 projects existing forms.
