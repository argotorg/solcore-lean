# Scalar source emitter meaning preservation

Updated: 2026-10-26. This records priority 5 of the
[next implementation roadmap](next-implementation-roadmap.md): a minimal
meaning-preservation theorem for what the Rust-dialect emitter actually prints.

## Result

The theorems are kernel-checked, contain no `sorry` and use only Lean's
standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`). The proofs live
in [ScalarMeaning](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning), which the
semantic-kernel policy check now covers.

| Theorem | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| `emit_source_meaning` | If `emit program = .ok emitted`, then for some Word `w`, `sourceCall emitted.source "run" [] = some w.val` and `CoreReturns program.program.toCore w`. |
| `Input.emit_source_meaning` | If `Input.emit function = .ok emitted`, then for every Word input `x` there is `w` with `sourceCall emitted.source "run" [x.val] = some w.val` and `CoreReturns (function.instantiate x).toCore w`. |
| `emit_preserves_meaning`, `Input.emit_preserves_meaning` | The same results, also exposing the source file `file` with `emitted.source = file.print` and `parseSource emitted.source = some file`. |
| `render_spec` | The induction over the actual `ScalarRenderer.render`, described below. |
| `parseSource_print` | The printed text of any file whose names are lexically valid and not reserved parses back to that file. |

`sourceCall` lexes the emitted `String`, parses it and calls the method under
the source semantics below. `CoreReturns core w` states that Core's
`runStateful` returns `.done (.word w) []` for all sufficiently large fuel, and
that every completed run returns exactly that Word and store. This is the Core
machine used as the differential-testing oracle; for the runtime-input profile
it runs the original lambda applied to the input. Unsupported operations remain
explicit emitter errors; the theorems say nothing about failed emissions.

## Independent source meaning

The source side ([Syntax](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Syntax.lean),
[Semantics](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Semantics.lean),
[Print](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Print.lean),
[Lex](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Lex.lean),
[Parse](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Parse.lean) and
[Text](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Text.lean)) does not
import or mention Core.

Syntax. Names, decimal literals, `true` and `false`; parenthesized `!` and `~`
applications; parenthesized infix `+`, `-`, `*`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `==` and `>`;
`Typedef.rep(e)` and `uint256(e)`. Statements are `let x: T = e;` with `T` one
of `word` or `bool`, `x = e;`, and `if (e) { ... } else { ... }`. A file imports
`std` and `std.dispatch` and declares one contract with one public method whose
parameters and declared result have type `uint256`, ending in `return e;`.

Tokens. Spaces and newlines only separate tokens. Identifiers are ASCII
letters, digits and `_`, not starting with a digit; numbers are unsigned
decimal; `==` is one token. Every operator application must be parenthesized,
so the grammar has no precedence rules. Seventeen words are reserved, including
`let`, `if`, `return`, `true`, `false`, `Typedef`, `rep` and `uint256`.

Values. A word is a natural number below `2^256`; there are also Booleans and
`uint256` values wrapping one word. A literal of `2^256` or more has no meaning.

Operators follow the pinned standard library (`std/std.sol` and
`std/opcodes.sol` at solcore-rs `2a745e12974c373c3799fec81b48a53c7dce2ab4`).
The Rust frontend desugars `+` to `Add.add`, `==` to `Eq.eq`, `>` to `Ord.gt`,
`~` to `BitNot.bnot` and `!` to the function `not`.

| Source | `word` instance chain | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a + b` | `Add.add` → `addWord` → `add` (assembly `add`) | `(a + b) mod 2^256` |
| `a - b` | `Sub.sub` → `subWord` → `sub` | `(a + 2^256 - b) mod 2^256` |
| `a * b` | `Mul.mul` → `mulWord` → `mul` | `(a * b) mod 2^256` |
| `a & b`, `a \| b`, `a ^ b` | `band`/`bor`/`bxor` → `bandWord`/`borWord`/`bxorWord` → `and`/`or`/`xor` | bitwise operation |
| `~a` | `BitNot.bnot` → `bnotWord` → `not` | `2^256 - 1 - a` |
| `a == b` | `Eq.eq` → `eqWord` → `tobool(eq(a, b))` | `a = b` |
| `a > b` | `Ord.gt` → `gtWord` → `tobool(gt(a, b))` | `a > b`, unsigned |
| `!c` | `not` | Boolean negation |

Locals live in a stack of lexical scopes. `let` declares in the innermost
scope and its value must have the annotated type; assignment updates the nearest
binding and must keep its type; an `if` condition must be Boolean, and each
branch runs in a fresh scope that is discarded afterwards. A method binds its
`uint256` parameters (each below `2^256`) in a parameter scope, runs its body in
a block scope inside it, and returns the word of a `uint256` result. A failed
lookup, type mismatch or non-Boolean condition has no meaning (`none`).

## Connection to the actual emitter

[RendererEquations](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/RendererEquations.lean)
unfolds the real `ScalarRenderer.render`, including its private helpers, by
definitional equality. It states each rendered case with the source syntax and
printer; no second renderer is defined.

`render_spec`, in [RendererPreservation](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/RendererPreservation.lean),
covers every Core expression admitted by `acceptsAt` that the renderer accepts:
literals, locals, `let`, `if`, `!`, `~` and the eight binary operators. For
temporaries numbered from `first`, the rendered lines are the printing of
source statements. Executing them from frames that agree with a Core
environment evaluates the expression by Core's big-step `Evaluates` relation.
The result is bound to the rendered value name. Only temporaries in
`[first, nextId)` are declared or changed, and enclosing scopes keep their
declared names. Each `if` result is declared with zero or `false` and assigned
at the end of both branch blocks. Freshness rests on the injectivity of
`sc_v<n>` names, derived from Lean's `Nat.toDigits`. Core Word operations are
related to the EVM formulas above.

[Emitter](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Emitter.lean) connects
the wrappers. `emit` prints `run()` returning `uint256(value)`. `Input.emit`
prints `run(input: uint256)` and first binds `sc_input` to
`Typedef.rep(input)`, matching Core's application of the lambda to the input.
Core machine results follow from `runStateful_evaluation_sound`,
`evaluation_runStateful_complete_with_sufficient_fuel` and determinism of
`Evaluates`.

[Text](../../Solcore/Synthesis/Source/ScalarMeaning/Text.lean) proves that the
printed text lexes to exactly the file's tokens and that `parseFile` inverts
them (`parseSource_print`). The meaning is therefore a function of the emitted
`String`, not of an internal printer argument.

## Assumptions outside the theorem

The theorem relates emitted text to Core. The following steps of the actual
Rust pipeline are assumed, and are exercised only by the existing tests:

1. Parsing. The pinned Rust parser reads the emitted text as the same
   structure as this grammar, including identifier, numeral and `==`
   tokenization and the parenthesized operator forms.
2. Name resolution and typing. The imports bring `word`, `bool`, `uint256` and
   `Typedef` into scope; the operators resolve to the cited `word` instances
   and `!` to `std.not`; decimal literals elaborate at `word`; the frontend
   accepts every emitted program. Rust acceptance is not proved.
3. Standard library meaning. The instance chains and opcode wrappers behave as
   transcribed in the table. The transcription is manual and cites the pinned
   files; it is not derived from the Rust frontend.
4. Compilation and execution. Specialization, lowering, Sonatina or Yul code
   generation, optimization, EVM execution and `std.dispatch` are assumed.
   This includes selector dispatch, `uint256` ABI decoding and 32-byte result
   encoding. Gas and EVM resource limits are not modeled; the source meaning
   has no fuel.

Differential agreement remains evidence for these steps, not a proof. Agreement
in a corpus also does not replace this theorem for the printer.

## Scope

The theorem covers the scalar renderer without helper functions
(`renderWithFunctions []`) and the closed G0 and runtime-input wrappers. It does
not cover helper calls (`CallGraphRenderer`), raw primitive aliases
(`PrimitiveRenderer`), aggregates, mutation, loops, storage, calls, closures,
generic, comptime or module emitters. Extending it next would add named helper
calls and the `std.opcodes` aliases, whose operand order and `tobool`
conversions are listed in the roadmap's priority 3 table.

## Executable checks

[SourceScalarMeaning](../../Solcore/Test/SourceScalarMeaning.lean) is registered
in the test driver. It runs actual emitter output through `sourceCall` and
compares the result with Core's `runStateful`. It covers all fifteen closed
fixtures, also against hand-known Words, and twelve runtime-input fixtures at
eight boundary inputs. Twenty programs from the first 96 G0 generator seeds
with a 40-node budget are emitted; the others are generator or emitter
exclusions. Each accepted text must reparse and print back to itself. Extra or
missing arguments, an undeclared method, `= =` in place of `==`, an
unparenthesized operator, an undeclared local, a mistyped declaration and a
literal of `2^256` are all rejected rather than given a value.
